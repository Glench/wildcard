# Wildcard

Wildcard is a platform that empowers anyone to build browser extensions and modify websites to meet their own specific needs.

Wildcard shows a simplified view of the data in a web page as a familiar table view. People can directly manipulate the table to sort/filter content, add annotations, and even use spreadsheet-style formulas to pull in data from other websites.

For more details, see the [paper](https://www.geoffreylitt.com/wildcard/salon2020/) presented at the Convivial Computing Salon 2020.
